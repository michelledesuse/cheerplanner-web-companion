# CheerTrack – Product Requirements (v1)

## Vision
A mobile app for cheer parents to keep every dollar, due date, hotel block, and competition organized in one place.

## Users
- A parent with one or more cheer athletes (kids).
- Authenticates with email & password (custom JWT).

## Core capabilities (v1 - MVP)
1. **Auth** – signup, login, JWT, bcrypt, rate-limited login. Tokens stored via SecureStore.
2. **Athletes** – CRUD; multiple athletes per parent; per-athlete totals (spent / paid / balance).
3. **Expenses** – per athlete (or **bulk multi-athlete**: select multiple athletes + toggle "Split equally" vs "Same per athlete"), categorized. Each expense exposes `paid_amount` and `balance_due`. Supports **partial payments**: tap the per-row "Apply" button to apply funds from manual cash or any fundraiser with available balance. Fully covered expenses auto-flip to `paid=true`.
4. **Payments** – per athlete (or **bulk multi-athlete** with same split-mode toggle) with method tracking (Card, Bank, Cash, Fundraiser, Other). Linkable to one or more expenses (`applied_expense_ids`). Payment rows show "Applied to: <category>" inline. Mark-paid auto-flip only fires when cumulative payments fully cover the expense.
5. **Competitions** – name, location, event date, housing required flag, booking link, booking-release datetime, notes.
6. **Travel & accommodations** – per competition: hotel (provider, conf#, check-in/out, cancel-by, cost, paid, balance, due), rental car (provider, conf#, cost), flight (airline, conf#, depart/arrive, return leg, cost). Travel-budget summary per competition.
7. **Reminders** – auto computed from expense due dates, hotel/booking balance due dates, hotel cancel-by, and competition booking release datetimes. Urgency levels: overdue / due soon (≤3d) / upcoming (≤7d) / future. Surfaced on dashboard & dedicated tab.
8. **Fundraisers** – simple ledger of money raised; totals on dashboard.
9. **Dashboard** – Home tab. Stat tiles (this month, paid YTD, athletes, raised), next competition card, top reminders, compact bottom balance strip (outstanding / expenses due / travel). Settings reachable via header gear icon.
10. **Settings** – profile, currency (USD), preferences view, sign out. (Not in main tabs; accessed via Home gear icon.)
11. **Competition assignment** – each athlete can be assigned to one or many competitions (multi-select). Toggles available from both Athlete detail and Competition detail screens.
12. **Calendar** (NEW v1.3) – month view with multi-dot markers from a single `/api/calendar` feed. Sources: expense due dates (red), competitions + end dates (blue), hotel checkin/checkout & flight depart/return (purple), fundraiser dates (green). Tapping a day surfaces all events for that date; tapping an event navigates to the related screen.

## Tab structure (v1.3)
**Home · Athletes · Expenses · Comps · Calendar**. The Expenses tab is a combined Money screen with an Expenses/Payments segmented control, "ALL/OPEN/PAID" filter, and a top-right quick-add button. Reminders & Settings remain accessible but are hidden from the tab bar.

## Tech
- Backend: FastAPI + Motor (MongoDB) + bcrypt + PyJWT + slowapi. UUID ids, ISO-string datetimes. `_id` excluded from all responses.
- Frontend: Expo Router (file-based), React Native, axios, Ionicons, SecureStore via `@/src/utils/storage`.
- Theme: Slate-900 primary, rose-600 accent, stone-50 background. Manrope/IBM Plex-equivalent system fonts.

## Out of scope (v1)
- Email & SMS reminders (planned for later — user opted to skip)
- Multi-parent collaboration
- Push notifications
- Reports/exports

## Smart growth hook
Fundraisers tracker — quietly turns parents into evangelists by letting them celebrate raised totals, share with their team, and offset upcoming dues. Future hook: shareable fundraiser links.
