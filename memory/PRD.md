# CheerTrack – Product Requirements (v1)

## Vision
A mobile app for cheer parents to keep every dollar, due date, hotel block, and competition organized in one place.

## Users
- A parent with one or more cheer athletes (kids).
- Authenticates with email & password (custom JWT).

## Core capabilities (v1 - MVP)
1. **Auth** – signup, login, JWT, bcrypt, rate-limited login. Tokens stored via SecureStore.
2. **Athletes** – CRUD; multiple athletes per parent; per-athlete totals (spent / paid / balance).
3. **Expenses** – per athlete, categorized (Tuition, Gear, Comp/Choreo, Camp, Uniform, etc.). Mark paid / unpaid. Optional due date.
4. **Payments** – per athlete with method tracking (Card, Bank, Cash, Fundraiser, Other).
5. **Competitions** – name, location, event date, housing required flag, booking link, booking-release datetime, notes.
6. **Travel & accommodations** – per competition: hotel (provider, conf#, check-in/out, cancel-by, cost, paid, balance, due), rental car (provider, conf#, cost), flight (airline, conf#, depart/arrive, return leg, cost). Travel-budget summary per competition.
7. **Reminders** – auto computed from expense due dates, hotel/booking balance due dates, hotel cancel-by, and competition booking release datetimes. Urgency levels: overdue / due soon (≤3d) / upcoming (≤7d) / future. Surfaced on dashboard & dedicated tab.
8. **Fundraisers** – simple ledger of money raised; totals on dashboard.
9. **Dashboard** – outstanding balance (split: expenses vs travel), month-to-date spend, paid YTD, athlete count, total raised, next competition card, top reminders.
10. **Settings** – profile, currency (USD), preferences view, sign out.

## Tech
- Backend: FastAPI + Motor (MongoDB) + bcrypt + PyJWT + slowapi. UUID ids, ISO-string datetimes. `_id` excluded from all responses.
- Frontend: Expo Router (file-based), React Native, axios, Ionicons, SecureStore via `@/src/utils/storage`.
- Theme: Slate-900 primary, rose-600 accent, stone-50 background. Manrope/IBM Plex-equivalent system fonts.

## Out of scope (v1)
- Email & SMS reminders (planned for later — user opted to skip)
- Multi-parent collaboration
- Push notifications
- Reports/exports

## Smart growth hook
Fundraisers tracker — quietly turns parents into evangelists by letting them celebrate raised totals, share with their team, and offset upcoming dues. Future hook: shareable fundraiser links.
